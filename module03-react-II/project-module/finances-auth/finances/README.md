# Expenses by Categories

### IGTI React Bootcamp 2021

### Module 03 - React II - TypeScript

Following the lecturer Danilo Ferreira e Silva in this introductory module on TypeScript, students are taught to develop an application to display a list of personal expenses. The user will be able to pick up a specific date (by year and month) to access all records of the chosen date.

### Goals

Apply concepts of React and TypeScript, including DOM interaction, HTTP request, user authentication, state management, hooks creation, data rendering and React Router. 

The following criteria should be met:
1. Display the records of a specific date;
2. Calculate the total of expenses of the chosen date.
3. Display results in Resume and Detailed options, where Resume returns the total expenses in categories, and Detailed returns a list with all expenses of the period;
4. Add user authentication to your application.

### Status: 

In development.
