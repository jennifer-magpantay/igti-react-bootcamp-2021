### IGTI React Bootcamp 2021

### Module 02 - React

Develop an application to calculate and display the evolution of fund income. 

The following requeriments must be met:

1. Display the income of seven funds during a given year. Funding data will be provided in JSON format to be consumed.

2. You will have to transform this content, which is in JSON format, into variables in memory, which will have to be read by the React component that will perform the data rendering.

3. In addition, build a caluclation, based on the data released, the percentage of total income/loss (between January and December) and the percentage of income/loss each month.

### Goals

Implement the application by using regular JavaScript, React, and function components, work around data rendering, and different types of calculation.

### Status

In progress.
